## Purpose & Promise
- Accelerate Cutting Edge progression with objective loot.
- Replace drama with transparent metrics.
- Spend raid time on pulls, not spreadsheets.

---

## How Decisions Are Made
- `FLPS = (RMS × IPI) × RDF`
- RMS: attendance, mechanics, preparation.
- IPI: upgrade value, tier priority, role multiplier.
- RDF: fairness rotation after recent wins.

---

## Raider Responsibilities (RMS)
- Attendance: warn officers, no no-shows.
- Mechanics: deaths & avoidable damage tracked via Logs/Wipefest.
- Preparation: vault slots, crest spending, heroic farming.

---

## Item Priority (IPI)
- Submit Droptimizer URLs weekly.
- Complete 2pc → 4pc before fifth-piece upgrades.
- Role multipliers adjust for progression bottlenecks.

---

## Recency & Fairness (RDF)
- A-tier: -20% for two raid weeks.
- B-tier: -10% for one raid week.
- C-tier: no penalty.
- RDF ledger visible in WoWAudit.

---

## Data & Tools
- WoWAudit, RC Loot Council, Warcraft Logs, Raidbots.
- Kotlin data-sync service (in progress) for automated scoring.
- Interim dashboard: see `docs/dashboard-prototype.md`.

---

## Example Pull
- Fyr'alath demo (RogueB wins at FLPS 0.583).
- Eligibility gate keeps HunterC out (MAS penalty).
- Announcement template in `docs/discord-templates.md`.

---

## Appeals & Feedback
- Use Discord ticket system off-raid hours.
- Provide FLPS breakdown when appealing.
- LC responds with data references (RMS/IPI/RDF).

---

## Action Items
- Refresh Droptimizer sims by Friday.
- Install required addons (RCLC, MRT, Wipefest sync).
- Verify WoWAudit profile and attendance sync.
