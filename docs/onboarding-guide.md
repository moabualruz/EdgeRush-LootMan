# EdgeRush LootMan Onboarding Guide

This outline gives raid leadership a plug-and-play script for introducing EdgeRush LootMan to the roster during the pre-tier boot camp or first raid night. Adapt timings to your schedule.

## Session Agenda (30 minutes)
1. **Purpose & Promise (5 min)**
   - Frame: “EdgeRush LootMan exists to get us to Cutting Edge faster with less loot drama.”
   - Emphasize raid-first mindset: collective progression beats personal ilvl.
2. **How Decisions Are Made (10 min)**
   - Walk through the FLPS formula, pointing to live examples in WoWAudit.
   - Highlight RMS responsibilities (attendance, mechanics, preparation).
   - Showcase Droptimizer submissions and token-based tier priorities.
3. **Tools & Expectations (7 min)**
   - Confirm every raider has RC Loot Council, WoWAudit access, and Raidbots premium (or a buddy system to run sims).
   - Demonstrate where to upload sims, check RDF cooldowns, and submit wishlists.
4. **Appeals & Feedback Loop (5 min)**
   - Explain Discord ticket workflow, response timelines, and audit transparency.
   - Reinforce that loot questions happen outside raid hours.
5. **Q&A / Next Steps (3 min)**
   - Collect immediate concerns.
   - Assign follow-up tasks (e.g., “submit fresh Droptimizer runs by tomorrow”).

## Key Talking Points
- **Progression First**: Every drop is a raid resource selected to defeat the next wall.
- **Math Beats Opinion**: Decisions cite RMS/IPI/RDF; personal feelings are acknowledged but data wins.
- **Shared Responsibility**: Raiders keep sims, wishlists, and attendance updated; officers enforce rules consistently.
- **Transparency Assurance**: All inputs live in WoWAudit; RDF history shows rotation; officers recuse when eligible for loot.
- **Conflict Channeling**: Disputes go to Discord tickets with explicit references to the score model.

## Pre-Session Checklist
- [ ] WoWAudit roster updated with latest attendance, sims, and loot history.
- [ ] Example FLPS calculation prepared (use `docs/score-model.md` sample).
- [ ] Slides or screen share deck ready (suggested outline below).
- [ ] Discord ticket template configured (`/ticket Loot Question`).
- [ ] Post-session reminders scheduled (e.g., “Droptimizer refresh due by Friday”).

## Suggested Slide or Screen Share Outline
1. **Title**: “EdgeRush LootMan: Loot that Wins Bosses”
2. **Mission Statement**: one slide summarizing accelerated progression and zero drama goals.
3. **FLPS Equation**: break down RMS, IPI, RDF with the current tier art for theme.
4. **RMS Responsibilities**: list attendance/mechanics/prep expectations.
5. **IPI Inputs**: show a Droptimizer screenshot and WoWAudit wishlist view.
6. **RDF Rotation**: table displaying current penalties so raiders understand the cooldowns.
7. **Appeal Flow**: “Raid time is for pulls. Tickets handle loot questions.”
8. **Action Items**: sims due dates, addon requirements, contact officer for issues.

## Post-Session Follow-up
- Send a summary note in Discord linking to this onboarding guide and the score model doc.
- Track completion of assigned tasks (sims submitted, addons installed) using WoWAudit or a shared checklist.
- Schedule a 10-minute check-in after the first Mythic night to gather feedback and adjust messaging.
